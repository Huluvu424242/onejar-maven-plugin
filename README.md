onejar for Maven Central
===========================================

A copy of the code from http://code.google.com/p/onejar-maven-plugin/. Please see this site for usage information. The
only difference here is that this plugin is available in Maven Central.

The only difference when using this version is that there is no separate repository required and that the ``groupId``
has to be set to ``com.jolira``.
